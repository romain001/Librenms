Introduction
------------

LibreNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring
which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating
systems including Cisco, Linux, FreeBSD, Juniper, Brocade, Foundry, HP and
many more.  LibreNMS is a community-based fork of [Observium][9].

We intend LibreNMS to be a viable project and community that:
- encourages contribution,
- focuses on the needs of its users, and
- offers a welcoming, friendly environment for everyone.

The [Debian Social Contract][10] will be the basis of our priority system,
and mutual respect is the basis of our behaviour towards others.  For more
about the culture we're trying to build, please read the [Freenode
philosophy][13], including [guidelines for running an IRC channel][6] and
[being a community catalyst][7].


Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be found in the [doc directory][5] or [docs.librenms.org][16], including instructions
for installing and contributing.


Participating
-------------

You can participate in the project by:
- Talking to us on IRC ([##librenms on Freenode][4]) or [Twitter][3].
- Joining the [librenms-project][1] mailing list.
- Improving the [documentation][5].
- Cloning the [repo][2] and filing [bug reports][18] and [pull requests][19] on github.
  See [CONTRIBUTING][15] for more details.


VM image
--------

You can try LibreNMS by downloading a VM image.  Currently, a Ubuntu-based
image is supplied and has been tested with [VirtualBox][8].

Download the [VirtualBox / VMWare image][11] and open it then log in with credentials provided. 
Enter the following command:

    ./daily.sh

You'll then need to find out the IP of your VM (`ifconfig | grep add`) and
create a DNS entry for `librenms.example.com` to point to that IP.  You can
also edit your `/etc/hosts` file with the following line:

    $ip librenms.example.com

where `$ip` is the IP of your VM.

Add a new user by entering:

    ./adduser.php <username> <password> 10 <email>

replace <username>, <password> and <email> with a username, password and your email address.

From there, just point your web browser
to `http://librenms.example.com/` and login with your new username and password.
